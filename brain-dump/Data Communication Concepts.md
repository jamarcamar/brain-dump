### Fundamentals of storytelling

#### Data storytelling road
Story --> Tech or not tech --> Data --> Viz --> Present
- Anecdotes = imagination
- Stories = memorable
- Add value (provide context)
- Capture audience's attention
- Facilitate decision-making
- Drive change

#### ADEPT Technique
- Analogy
- Diagram
- Example
- Plain English
- Technical definition

#### Narrative Structure
- Background
- Insight 1
- Insight 2
- Climax
- Next steps

#### Building Narrative
- Change over time -- chocolate lower in summer and higher in winter
- Correlation -- chocolate rating vs. price
- Comparison -- two age groups vs. chocolate consumption
- Clustering -- groups with different coffee and chocolate consumption


#### Elements of Data Story Telling
- Data
	- garbage in, garbage out
	- adapt to audience
- Narrative
- Visuals


#### McCandless method
1. Introduce visualization by name
	1. Graph headline
	2. Clear and obvious
	3. y vs x technique 
2. Anticipate audience's questions
	1. Focus on story not on decoding graph
3. State insights
4. Help the audience relate
	1. Importance
	2. Action items

### How to structure a written reports

#### Types of reports
1. Informational
	- Factual information
	- Short
	- Not strict structure
	- Inform about facts
2. Analytical
	- Analysis (relationships/recommendations)
	- Varies (short or long)
	- Strict structure
	- Data-driven decisions
3. Final report
	- Elements
		- Data analysis
		- Findings and results
		- Visuals
	- Format
		- Long
	- Audience
		- Details
4. Summary reports
	- Elements
		- Key findings and recommendations
		- Visuals
	- Format
		- Short (<5 pages)
		- Summary of final report
		- Link to main document
	- Audience
		- No need for details

#### Report structure
1. Introduction
	1. Purpose
		1. Analysis of the product reviews gathered from website
		2. Rating prediction based on review
	2. Contextual information
		1. Increase in negative reviews
	3. Question of analysis
		1. Factor affecting bad user experience
2. Body
	1. Data
		1. Description and tables
	2. Methods
		1. NL and Random Forest
	3. Analysis
		1. Visuals
			1. Graphs with most common words
	4. Results
		1. Description and visuals
3. Conclusions
	1. Restate the question
	2. Summarize important results
	3. Add recommendations

- Business context
- 1-3-35
	- 1 page of abstract
	- ? 3 pages of executive summary
	- ? 25 pages of detail

#### Reproducibility and replicability virtues
- Prevents duplication of effort
- Build upon pre-existing work
- Focus on new challenges
- Peer review
- Tool agnostic

#### Best practices
1. Keep track of how results were produced
	1. Well document scripts
		1. Comments in code
	2. List packages and environment used
	3. Version control
2. Avoid manual data manipulation
	1. Data versioning
	2. Store raw data and intermediate steps
	3. Adapt and resolve problems
3. Control randomness
	1. Random seed for ML pipelines
	2. Control confounding variable
4. Interpretability
	1. Understand the cause of a decision or predict model results
	2. Story with compelling narrative
	3. Link with reproducibility
5. Cite bibliography correctly
